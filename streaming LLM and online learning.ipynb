    "# **Tutorial on Streaming LLMs: Inference, Training, and Simultaneous Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore streaming Large Language Models (LLMs) by discussing the concepts of streaming inference, training (online learning), and simultaneous inference and training. We will cover high-level intuitions, core algorithmic details, and provide simple Python implementations for each concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 1a: Streaming Inference**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **High-Level Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming inference refers to the process of handling data that arrives continuously and producing outputs in real-time. Instead of waiting for the entire input data to be available, the model processes smaller chunks of data as they arrive and generates incremental outputs. This approach is crucial for applications like live transcription, chatbots, or real-time monitoring systems, where immediate responses are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Use Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a live transcription service where speech is being converted to text in real-time. As the speaker continues to talk, the system continuously processes the incoming audio data, updates the context with each new sentence or phrase, and generates the transcription incrementally. This allows the service to produce text almost instantly, maintaining the flow of conversation or presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Core Algorithmic Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Chunking:** The continuous data stream is broken into manageable chunks (e.g., sentences or phrases).\n",
    "2. **State Management:** The model maintains and updates a context or state that accumulates information from previous chunks.\n",
    "3. **Incremental Output Generation:** The model generates outputs after processing each chunk, based on the updated state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Python Implementation**\n",

    "### Part 1b: Implementing a Simple Streaming LLM Using GPT-2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement a simple streaming Large Language Model (LLM) using the GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library. Streaming LLMs are useful in scenarios where data arrives continuously, and immediate processing and output generation are required. Examples include live transcription, chatbots, or any application that needs to handle real-time data streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll simulate a text stream and process it incrementally, maintaining context between chunks and using the model to predict the next word based on the evolving context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind streaming LLMs is to handle data that arrives in chunks and generate outputs in real-time. Unlike batch processing, where the entire dataset is processed at once, streaming processing deals with data incrementally. This approach is particularly useful when working with large or continuous data streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we'll use the pre-trained GPT-2 model to process a series of text chunks as they arrive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model and Tokenizer Initialization:**\n",
    "   - We load the GPT-2 model and its associated tokenizer, which are pre-trained on a large corpus of text. The model is set to evaluation mode since we are not training but only making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulated Text Stream:**\n",
    "   - We define a series of text chunks that simulate data arriving in a stream. Each chunk represents a portion of the overall input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Management:**\n",
    "   - We maintain a context that accumulates the content of all previous chunks. This context is crucial for generating meaningful predictions as it provides the necessary background for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Chunk Processing and Prediction:**\n",
    "   - For each incoming chunk, the context is updated, and the model generates a prediction for the next word based on the current context. The prediction is made using greedy decoding, where the model selects the word with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Incremental Output Generation:**\n",
    "   - The model's prediction, along with the updated context, is printed after processing each chunk. This demonstrates how the model's understanding evolves as more data is fed into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to use a pre-trained language model like GPT-2 in a streaming context, enabling you to build real-time applications that require immediate processing and responses."
