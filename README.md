# Streaming LLM and Online Learning

Welcome to the repository for exploring the concepts of Streaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and Online Learning. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to implement and utilize a streaming LLM using GPT-2 and discusses the principles of online learning, including simultaneous inference and training.

## Repository Contents

- `streaming LLM and online learning.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that:
  - Demonstrates how to implement a streaming LLM using the pre-trained GPT-2 model.
  - Explores the concept of online learning with practical Python code examples.
  - Illustrates simultaneous inference and training to show how a model can adapt in real-time to new data.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the notebook:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- pip
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/galenwilkerson/streaming-LLM-and-online-learning.git
   cd streaming-LLM-and-online-learning
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```



### Running the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

Open the `streaming LLM and online learning.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to see the implementation in action.
